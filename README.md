FiM++
=====

**FiM++** (AKA **Friendship Reports**) is a programming language inspired by [Friendship Reports](//mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_reports), [Java](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Shakespeare](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(programming_language)), whose syntax is not dissimilar to that of [ALGOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL). The main goal of FiM++ is to be readable by people, to the point that a well-written FiM++ program could be mistaken for being a mere letter.
