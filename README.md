FiMpp
=====

FiM++ (AKA Friendship Reports) is a programming language inspired by Friendship Reports, Java, and Shakespeare, whose syntax is not dissimilar to that of ALGOL. The main goal of FiM++ is to be readable by people, to the point that a well-written FiM++ program could be mistaken for being a mere letter.
